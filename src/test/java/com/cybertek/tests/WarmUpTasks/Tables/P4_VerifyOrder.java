PRACTICE #4: Method: verifyOrder
• Create a method named verifyOrder in SmartBearUtils class.
• Method takes WebDriver object and String(name).
• Method should verify if given name exists in orders.
• This method should simply accepts a name(String), and assert whether
given name is in the list or not.
• Create a new TestNG test to test if the method is working as expected.
